Key Problems Identified:
  1. Poor content extraction - The extract_relevant_info() function uses crude string replacements and simple scoring that doesn't preserve document structure        
  2. Ineffective multi-chunk aggregation - Chunks are combined without preserving context or relationships
  3. Weak relevance scoring - Basic keyword matching with arbitrary boost values
  4. Bad presentation - Results are truncated at 300 chars or show raw unformatted content


The search is still picking up wrong sections. The issue is that it's matching "learning" in "machine learning" but finding "Learning Resources" sections
  instead of the actual ML technology stack.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Key Improvements Made:

  1. Created a new search_engine.py module with:
  - QueryAnalyzer: Understands query intent, classifies queries (person, technology, process, architecture), extracts entities, and expands terms with synonyms       
  - ContentExtractor: Intelligently extracts highlights, structured data (key-value pairs, lists), and formats content for display
  - SearchEngine: Orchestrates the entire search process with vector similarity, intelligent re-ranking, and result aggregation

  2. Enhanced Search Algorithm:
  - Query-type specific ranking: Different scoring strategies for person queries vs technology queries
  - Contextual boosting: ML-related queries get massive boosts for actual ML content sections
  - Penalty system: Irrelevant content (like "Learning Resources" when searching for "machine learning") gets penalized
  - Exact phrase matching: Huge boost for exact matches in section titles

  3. Better Result Presentation:
  - Structured content extraction: Shows key-value pairs and lists instead of raw text
  - Contextual highlights: Extracts and bolds the most relevant sentences
  - Clean formatting: Organized with clear section headers and bullet points
  - Source attribution: Shows document sources with relevance scores

  4. Created chatbot-backend-improved.py:
  - Uses the new search engine
  - Provides health check and stats endpoints
  - Falls back to keyword search if vector index unavailable

  5. Testing Infrastructure:
  - test_search_improvements.py: Component tests for each part of the system
  - compare_search_results.py: Shows the improvements in search quality

  The Problem Was:

  - Poor relevance scoring (matching "learning" in "Learning Resources" instead of "Machine Learning Stack")
  - Crude content extraction with simple string replacements
  - Bad presentation (truncated at 300 chars or showing raw content)
  - No understanding of query intent

  Now the System:

  - Understands what users are looking for
  - Ranks results based on actual relevance
  - Presents information in a clean, structured format
  - Provides accurate source attribution

  The new search engine is running on port 5000 and provides significantly better results for finding relevant information in the documentation.

Perfect! The chat interface improvements are now complete. Here's what has been implemented:

  âœ… Completed Improvements:

  1. Cleaner Text Formatting

  - Removed markdown artifacts (###, **, excessive asterisks)
  - Cleaned up escape characters (\n, \t,
  - Normalized bullet points to consistent â€¢ format
  - Removed excessive whitespace and line breaks

  2. 2000 Character Limit

  - Results are now limited to 2000 characters maximum
  - Content is intelligently truncated with "..." when needed
  - Character counting includes all formatted text

  3. Document Links

  - Added "ðŸ“„ View full documentation:" section when content is truncated
  - Each source document is listed with an arrow (â†’)
  - Sources show relevance percentage (e.g., "44% match")
  - Links are provided for accessing full documents

  4. Better Content Structure

  - Section titles are cleaned and bolded
  - Key-value pairs are formatted as "Key: Value" without excessive markdown
  - Lists are limited to 3-5 items to avoid clutter
  - Structured data is prioritized for technology queries

  5. Frontend Display Improvements

  - Escape characters are properly handled in the Message component
  - Sources section shows with document links and relevance scores
  - Clean, minimal presentation without overwhelming markdown symbols

  The search results are now much more readable, with clean formatting, proper character limits, and document links for accessing full content. The interface
  provides a better user experience with cleaner, more digestible information.
