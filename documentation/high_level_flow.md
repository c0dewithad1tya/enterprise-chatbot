## SYSTEM OVERVIEW FLOW

The Enterprise Knowledge Chatbot operates through a series of interconnected flows that handle user queries, document processing, and knowledge retrieval. This document outlines the primary flows within the system.

## 1. USER INTERACTION FLOW

### Step 1: User Access
- User navigates to chatbot URL
- System loads frontend interface
- Theme preferences are loaded from localStorage
- User authentication (if required)

### Step 2: Query Submission
- User types question in chat interface
- Real-time validation of input
- Query sent to backend API via POST request
- Loading indicator displayed

### Step 3: Response Generation
- Backend receives query
- Query processed and embedded
- Vector search performed
- Context retrieved from knowledge base
- LLM generates response
- Response returned to frontend

### Step 4: Display Results
- Response rendered in chat interface
- Source documents displayed
- Links to original sources provided
- Chat history updated

## 2. DOCUMENT INDEXING FLOW

### Step 1: Source Connection
- Administrator configures source (Confluence/Git)
- Authentication credentials validated
- Connection established

### Step 2: Content Discovery
- System crawls configured spaces/repositories
- List of documents/files generated
- Filtering rules applied
- Queue created for processing

### Step 3: Document Processing
- Documents fetched from source
- Text extraction performed
- Content cleaned and normalized
- Metadata extracted

### Step 4: Chunking Process
- Documents split into chunks (1000 chars)
- Overlap maintained (200 chars)
- Chunk metadata preserved
- Relationships tracked

### Step 5: Embedding Generation
- Each chunk processed through embedding model
- Vector representations created
- Embeddings normalized
- Quality checks performed

### Step 6: Storage
- Vectors stored in FAISS index
- Metadata stored in database
- Mappings maintained
- Index optimized

## 3. SEARCH AND RETRIEVAL FLOW

### Query Processing
1. User query received
2. Query preprocessing
   - Spell checking
   - Query expansion
   - Intent detection

### Semantic Search
1. Query embedded using same model
2. Vector similarity search
3. Top-k results retrieved (k=5 default)
4. Re-ranking based on metadata

### Context Assembly
1. Retrieved chunks analyzed
2. Deduplication performed
3. Context window constructed
4. Source attribution added

### Response Generation
1. Context + Query sent to LLM
2. Prompt engineering applied
3. Response generated
4. Post-processing and formatting
5. Citation links added

## 4. THEME MANAGEMENT FLOW

### Theme Selection
1. User clicks theme selector
2. Available themes displayed
3. User selects theme
4. Theme ID sent to backend

### Theme Application
1. CSS variables fetched from backend
2. Existing theme removed
3. New theme CSS injected
4. Component styles updated
5. Preference saved to localStorage

### Theme Persistence
1. User ID retrieved/generated
2. Theme preference sent to API
3. Backend stores preference
4. Database updated
5. Confirmation returned

## 5. CONFLUENCE INTEGRATION FLOW

### Initial Setup
1. Confluence URL configured
2. API credentials provided
3. Connection tested
4. Spaces discovered

### Space Indexing
1. Space selected for indexing
2. All pages in space retrieved
3. Page hierarchy maintained
4. Content extracted
5. Attachments processed

### Synchronization
1. Webhook configured (optional)
2. Changes detected
3. Delta updates processed
4. Index refreshed
5. Cache invalidated

## 6. GIT REPOSITORY FLOW

### Repository Setup
1. Repository URL provided
2. Authentication configured
3. Clone/pull performed
4. Branch selected

### File Processing
1. Repository scanned
2. Relevant files identified
   - Markdown files
   - Documentation
   - README files
   - Code comments
3. Content extracted
4. Structure preserved

### Update Flow
1. Periodic pull scheduled
2. Changes detected
3. Modified files re-indexed
4. Deleted files removed
5. New files added

## 7. ERROR HANDLING FLOW

### Error Detection
1. Error occurs in any component
2. Error logged with context
3. Error category determined

### Error Response
1. User-friendly message generated
2. Technical details logged
3. Fallback behavior activated
4. Administrator notified (if critical)

### Recovery Process
1. Automatic retry attempted
2. Circuit breaker activated if needed
3. Degraded mode enabled
4. Manual intervention requested

## 8. AUTHENTICATION FLOW

### User Login
1. User accesses application
2. Redirect to OAuth provider
3. User authenticates
4. Authorization code received
5. Token exchange performed
6. User session created

### Session Management
1. Session token stored
2. Token validated on each request
3. Refresh token used when expired
4. Logout clears session

## 9. MONITORING FLOW

### Metrics Collection
1. Application metrics gathered
2. Performance data collected
3. Error rates tracked
4. Usage statistics compiled

### Alert Flow
1. Thresholds monitored
2. Alerts triggered
3. Notifications sent
4. Incident created
5. Response team notified

## 10. BACKUP AND RECOVERY FLOW

### Backup Process
1. Scheduled backup initiated
2. Vector index snapshot created
3. Database backed up
4. Configuration exported
5. Backup verified and stored

### Recovery Process
1. Failure detected
2. Last valid backup identified
3. Services stopped
4. Data restored
5. Services restarted
6. Validation performed

## FLOW OPTIMIZATION STRATEGIES

### 1. Caching Strategy
- Query results cached
- Frequently accessed documents cached
- Embedding cache maintained
- TTL-based invalidation

### 2. Parallel Processing
- Document processing parallelized
- Batch embedding generation
- Concurrent API calls
- Async operations

### 3. Load Balancing
- Request distribution
- Resource allocation
- Queue management
- Auto-scaling triggers

## PERFORMANCE METRICS

### Target Metrics
- **Query response time:** < 2 seconds
- **Document indexing:** 100 docs/minute
- **Concurrent users:** 1000+
- **Uptime:** 99.9%
- **Index accuracy:** > 95%

## TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

### Common Issues

#### 1. Slow response times
- Check vector index size
- Verify cache hit rate
- Monitor API latency

#### 2. Indexing failures
- Validate source connectivity
- Check authentication
- Review error logs

#### 3. Incorrect results
- Verify embedding model
- Check chunking strategy
- Review context window
